# MisMatchNegativity
Passive MMN task based on duration.

This repository contains:
  - Matlab code #MMN_duration_XXX# to run the MMN task, depending on the branch, in:
    - laboratory
    - train 
    Using EEG (change the triggers code):
      - BrainProduct (LiveAmp) 
      - AntNeuro (EEGO)
  - Matlab code #GenerateSounds_Y# to create empty sounds (two burst of 5ms white noisedelimit the sound) of different duration
  - Matlab code #mkTimeKeeperSpeak# too check the timing in our task
  - Directory #SOUNDS# containing the sounds use in the task
  - Directory #RESULTS# where the experimental Matrices will be saved
