Passive MMN task based on duration.

This repository contains:
  - Matlab code to run the MMN task, depending on the branch, in:
        - laboratory
        - train 
        Using EEG (change the triggers code):
            - BrainProduct (LiveAmp) 
            - AntNeuro (EEGO)
  - Matlab code to create empty sounds (two burst of 5ms white noisedelimit the sound) of different duration
  - Directory SOUNDS containing the sounds use in the task
  - Directory RESULTS where the experimental Matrices will be saved
